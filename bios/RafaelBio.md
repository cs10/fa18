## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born to a Uruguayan dad and a Panamanian mom in Tokyo, Japan. We moved to Ciudad de Panamá, Panamá when I was two, where I was raised until I came to Berkeley. Even though I am a CS major, originally I wanted to be a Chemical Engineering major, and because Panamá had no ChemE program I had to look somewhere else and Cal seemed like a great place.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I had never done programming before CS 10. I fell in love with it after Dan’s lecture on abstraction and I have pursued to learn a lot. Now I know English, Spanish and French (ba dum tss). I also know Python, C, C++, Hack and PHP, HTML, CSS, Snap!, and Java.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I need to be hanging out with people or somewhere that it is not my place. I am a very outdoorsy person and I especially enjoy Photography and traveling to new and remote places, especially the ones in which I can learn and understand the struggle and problems that the underprivileged face (especially in Latin America); all of which I plan to fix using computing.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I have a very dark sense of humor which my friends tend to enjoy (sometimes too much). I can also connect with strangers very easily.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

Having a family that supports me whenever I need and being able to be born and raised in a very International and Latin American household is something I always feel grateful about.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

CS 10, CS 170, CS 168, CS 61C, NESTUD C26 (a class on Central Asia), working on a start-up with a friend, and working on my own projects (hopefully).
