## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I was born in Reno, Nevada, and moved to the East Bay Area about halfway through high school. Cal was close to my new home, and I’m a big fan of bears. Kodiaks are my favorite species. (gobears)

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I’ve done quite a bit of programming now just by the way of coursework. I’ve learned R (my favorite programming language by far) Python, Java, C, Snap!, and more.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I don’t really have time spend on fun things. Most of my free time is consumed by sleeping or thinking about the work I’m not doing. Sometimes, instead of doing my own work I’ll redo the CS10 homework assignments to see how many ways I can solve them. I do try to go to the beach with my mom on some weekends, I mostly just sleep there too though.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I was an ultra-lightweight wrestling champion in high school, so I can take people down if I need to. I’ve also been told that my range of expressions is really dense, I apparently have a bunch of different faces just for ‘perplexed by human humor’.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I successfully convinced another member of staff to write my CS10 bio for me (thanks Grant).

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Mostly just spending time on classes, because I like to challenge myself. Unfortunately, my immune system has deteriorated a little bit so I’m always on the verge of coming sick and require hibernation to avoid illness.
