## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up mostly in the High Desert town of Palmdale, California. I went to Quartz Hill High School, one of the last schools in my valley to offer an IB program. I was almost set on going to UCLA until Cal Day, where I changed my mind after falling in love with the Berkeley campus and marching band.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
My first time coding was in CS10 with Snap! during my first semester at Cal. Some languages I’ve programmed in are Python, Java, and C, as well as a little HTML and JavaScript doing web development for Cal Band.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love playing music and going to concerts. Some of the shows I’m looking forward to this semester are Arcade Fire w/ Grizzly Bear and Interpol.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I play piano, french horn, mellophone, and am currently trying to pick up guitar.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
My freshman year I had the chance to perform in the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with Coldplay, Beyoncé, and Bruno Mars! I’ve clung to that that as my go to fun fact ever since.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
This semester I’m taking CS 162 (Operating Systems), CS 186 (Databases), and Music 158A (Sound and Music Computing). Besides classes and CS10, a lot of my hours go into preparing for each football game with the band.
