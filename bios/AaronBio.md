## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Pasadena, California and went to an all boys Catholic high school in La Ca√±ada. I first visited Cal after my junior year and was immediately enamored. Since coming, my opinion really hasn't changed; and my favorite part of the school remains my fellow students, who I continue to consider my best resource for learning.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

Before taking CS10 a year ago, I had no programming experience. However since then I have learned python, scheme, (a little) MatLab, and am now learning java.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Most of the things I do for fun I wouldn't consider full fledged hobbies (I blame it on my sometimes short attention span), but I do consistently play music with friends and love going to movies and concerts.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can do the alphabet backwards and swallow ice cubes whole on accident.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I can't say, or don't remember. One of the two.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I'll be teaching you, trying to soak up some info from my classes, managing the Sneak Previews department of ASUC SUPERB, and preparing to go abroad to Chile in the spring!
