## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in a tiny farm town in Southeastern Massachusetts. I had never left the East Coast before I got accepted to Cal and when I got in, I knew I wanted to go on adventure so I decided to pack up and move out to the West Coast. 3 years later, I have to say it was a great decision, I love all things California!!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

CS10 in the Spring 2017 was the start of my programming career and I picked it up with learning Python, Scheme and SQLite in CS61A. I hope to learn Java and R soon though!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I am a diehard Boston sports fan and especially the Patriots and Celtics. I have 3 Tom Brady Jerseys and my room is adorned with 6+ Sports Banners. I’m a political junkie and I’m always on Twitter engaging in discourse on issues ranging from Education to Economic Policies.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

My biggest passion at Cal and in life is teaching and education. You can catch me tutoring, teaching or mentoring almost every single day!

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I once met Colin Kaepernick outside the Starbucks in Downtown Berkeley and later that week I ran into Marshawn Lynch outside Barrows Hall. 

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I am currently involved in 2-3 research projects that occupy my time besides classes and CS10! Projects I’m working on right now include:

How students from different schools in the same city can build relationships through video chatting and how these bonds form?

What is the nature of the effects spawned from an equity-driven freshman seminar designed to help students adjust to life at a large state university?

What are the cognitive processes that inform students in their acceptance/rejection of climate change and what statistical effects can a environmental science curriculum have on these world views?
