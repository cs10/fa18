## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in a tiny farm town in Southeastern Massachusetts. I had never left the East Coast before I got accepted to Cal and when I got in, I knew I wanted to go on adventure so I decided to pack up and move out to the West Coast. 3 years later, I have to say it was a great decision, I love all things California!!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

CS10 in the Spring 2017 was the start of my programming career and I picked it up with learning Python, Scheme and SQLite in CS61A. I hope to learn Java and R soon though!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I am a diehard Boston sports fan and especially the Patriots and Celtics. I have 3 Tom Brady Jerseys and my room is adorned with 6+ Sports Banners. I’m a political junkie and I’m always on Twitter engaging in discourse on issues ranging from Education to Economic Policies.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

My biggest passion at Cal and in life is teaching and education. You can catch me tutoring, teaching or mentoring almost every single day!

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I once met Colin Kaepernick outside the Starbucks in Downtown Berkeley and later that week I ran into Marshawn Lynch outside Barrows Hall.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

In my spare time, I teach at middle school after school programs throughout Oakland and Richmond. I also love taking education classes and learning how to be a better teacher!
