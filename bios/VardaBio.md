## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I was born in Bangalore (the Silicon Valley of India) but have lived in over eight cities across India, Bangladesh and Indonesia. I attended incredibly diverse, international high schools and knew I wanted to attend university in the US. Cal was one of my top choices, and I’m so glad I’m here (I grew up in tropical Asia, so the East Coast is too cold for me).

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I came to Cal intending to major in Media Studies and didn’t have any programming experience before CS10. I’m now trying to double major with CS. I’ve programmed in Snap!, Python and Java.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love art; both appreciating and creating it. I also enjoy traveling (so far, I’ve been to over a dozen countries) and cooking (hmu for some bomb enchiladas and Indian food)!

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
Last summer, I attended a ten-day silent (sans technology) meditation retreat. Although it was really challenging, it was a memorable experience.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
CS10!! Also, my classes and clubs.
