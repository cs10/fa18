## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I was born in Sacramento, grew up in Southeast Michigan, and now I’m here again! We had ties to the area so Cal was always kind of on my radar.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

Actually none before CS10. Unfortunately, projects tend to take me a long time, so it feels like I’ve done quite a bit now. I’ve learned bits and pieces of Python, Java, Scheme, C, and had to teach myself basic Javascript for a job once.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I grew up in a college town and my family watched football and basketball almost religiously growing up, so I’m a big sports person. Anything with a scoreboard I’m into. I also really like learning about dinosaurs and animals. Sometimes I’ll walk through VLSB instead of around just see them.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I’ve played soccer and basketball for the vast majority of my lifetime, and I think I’m at least better than terrible.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

My CS10 lab partner and I tried to convince our TA we were step-siblings once. I don’t think he was convinced very long though, neither of us are actors.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I’m doing an Economics and Computer Science double, so honestly most of time is spent on classwork, trying to run a student org/small business, and contributing to CS10!
