## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in West Covina, California (626 wooooooooo). It's a pretty small city that's usually quiet and chill, and it's near a lot of cool places so there's usually something to do like eating food. I applied to Berkeley kind of on a whim —I didn't feel like reading about UCSD's various colleges— but legit freaked out when I got in still! I graduated from South Hills High School where I participated in a number of things, like marching band, organizing a TEDx conference, and helping to get the IB program going.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I started programming when I took CS10 in Spring 2017, so Snap! is also my first language ^^. Then there's some Python, Java, Swift, and a bit of html. My favorite languages are definitely Snap! and Python still; Snap! is quirky and I've grown to appreciate its bugs, and Python is super succinct.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I've picked up some weird hobbies like learning how to shine shoes, and slightly more normal ones like cooking. Shining shoes came about because I thought using the instant polish thing was lame, and the mirror shine had always been so intriguing to me. Cooking has become a more current hobby because food is so cool (and obviously tasty)! One of my favorite shows on Netflix is Chef's Table —food can tell such a compelling story about the chef, the land, and the culture it comes from!

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can play some mallet instruments like the marimba and vibraphone! I participated in my marching band/drum line's front ensemble so I got to play some instruments I know I won't have a chance to play for a while (sad reacts only). I'm pretty okay at cooking and extraordinarily gifted —arguably the best— at consuming the products of my cooking.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I once won a middle school essay contest because I was the only one that entered! (woo!!!!!). One of my favorite memories is briefly visiting the town of Jiufen in Taiwan. The teahouse in the city is what inspired the bath house in Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away. Its name roughly translates into "Nine Portions", and the story behind it is that a long time ago, only nine families lived in this town and it was super far from the market, so the families would take turns sending people to the market, bringing back nine portions of whatever they bought for each of the nine families.


## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

My classes include: Bio 1B (Plant Bio and stuff) , ESPM 100 (Environmental Problem Solving), CS61C (Great Ideas in Computer Architecture with Dan!!!!), CS188 (Artificial Intelligence), and CS375 (Introduction to Teaching Computer Science). I'll also be teaching a class called CS10, how exciting!
