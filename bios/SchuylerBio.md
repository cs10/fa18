## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I originally hail from the town of Sherman Oaks, California. It is a place known to locals for being extremely hot and to the rest of the world for being a part of Los Angeles. When I applied to college, Cal was actually at the very bottom of my list of schools! But after visiting the campus, I fell in love with the culture, diversity, and intellectual climate that make this school so unique. Today there is nowhere else I would rather be attending college. Berkeley is such a wonderful place to learn!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
CS10 was my first programming class when I took it back in Fall 2015. I originally expected to hate computer science, but ended up liking it so much that I decided to pursue a CS minor! Since then, I have learned Snap/Netsblox, Python, Java, Scheme, SQL, C, RISC-V, and some HTML. 

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
Um....studying?

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
Once upon a time, I was a young high school student with a lot of talents: playing clarinet, playing piano, and leading a speech & debate team. Then I came to college and forgot how to do all of them. Such is life.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
During my freshman year I joined an Ultimate Frisbee team and discovered that I am even less athletic than I previously thought. Over the course of two semesters, I managed to break my nose, injure my foot, sustain a contusion in my knee, and get two (yes, two) hernias. At the end of the year I won an award for “Most Likely to be Injured.”

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Let’s see...taking three classes, teaching CS10, participating in a few clubs, doing research, and cooking weekly meals for over one hundred people at my co-op. It will be a busy semester, but it should also be incredibly fun!
