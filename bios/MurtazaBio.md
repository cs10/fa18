## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in a small suburb in the east corner of Anaheim in Southern California (called Anaheim Hills—it’s about twenty minutes from Disneyland. I loved high school (which is surprising to a lot of people for some reason) I just applied to Cal to apply, but never really intended on coming here. However, it came down to a choice between Cal and UCLA. UCLA was too close, and Cal impressed me after I researched into it some more. Now I can’t picture myself anywhere else.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

In high school, I wanted to be a lawyer and couldn’t program a square to have sides. I had no clue how much I’d come to love computer science. I was introduced to a blocks-based language during Hour of Code once, thought it was boring and pointless, and never got into it. Then came CS10. The enthusiasm of the course staff rubbed off on me, and since then I’ve programmed in Snap! and Python. I’m planning on learning C++ this semester, time permitting.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and making conversation with people. You’ll also find me reading articles and watching videos about climate change. Occasionally, I will spend time reflecting on my life and the lives of those close to me, recording my thoughts in various journals.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I’m signed up for 19 units which are mostly technicals and I’m still smiling. I can also sing in Arabic. Kind of.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I won a sermon recitation competition once, and while it was definitely one of the most memorable things I’ve done, it isn’t the most remarkable thing that I have experienced. That honor must go to when I was doing box jumps, jumped off the box, and lacerated my head on the fenced ceiling. I didn’t feel any pain, and didn’t realize I was injured until I wiped my head and saw my hand covered in blood. There’s a great picture of me smiling after the injury.


## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

This semester, in addition to being a reader/LA+ for CS10, I’ll be taking CS 70 (so excited!), Math 54 (still excited but not as much as 70), Physics 7A, CS 370, and Drugs and the Brain. It’s possible I might have signed up for too many units. Well. That’s life I guess. In my free time (if it exists), I’ll play basketball, write, and cook.
