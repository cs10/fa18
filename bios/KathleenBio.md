## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in New Jersey, hibernating for half the year in the loving bosom of the electric blanket and lamenting the existence of mosquitos for the rest. When I first visited Cal, it was sunny, it was warm, there were dogs everywhere, and I was so sozzled. So that was that.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

Before I took CS10, I had the technological competency of a grandma and was overwhelmed by anything newfangled and shiny. Now, I can say Iâ€™ve dabbled in Snap!, Python, HTML, and Java.

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I like reading, drawing, playing cards, polishing soap, peeling poetry, squirrel fishing, and cleaning belly buttons until they sparkle.

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

Cleaning belly buttons until they sparkle.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I once caught a chicken at the Tennessee Derby.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Getting my education, hopefully. (And doing research and working at Cal Performances and eating ice cream before it melts)
