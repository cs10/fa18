## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in a small town in Southern California called La Cañada Flintridge.  In high school, some of the people I looked up to graduated from high school and came to CAL for college.  I realized CAL could also be a good place for me, so here I am!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
I started programming my freshman year at Berkeley (CS10)!  I know Python, Java, C, and Swift.  

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love to watch and play sports.  I am a very big Lakers (basketball) and Dodgers (baseball) fan.  I really enjoy talking about sports, so if you want to talk, let’s talk!

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
I play the alto saxophone.  I used to play a lot (in high school), but I haven’t been able to play much in college.

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I am a huge Hamilton (and Broadway) fan, so seeing the musical Hamilton on Broadway with the original cast was an amazing experience.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
I will be busy with CS10, my own classes, and looking for jobs/internships.  Hopefully, I can also find a cool club to join!
