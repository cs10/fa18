## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Calabasas, California which is in Northwest LA (No, I don't personally know the Kardashians). I came to Berkeley at the beginning of my senior year and I knew I wanted to attend given the opportunity. I came in Applied Math, but almost immediately veered toward the CS path.

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I took CS10 my first semester at Cal, and have since learned Scheme, Python, and SQL. I am currently learning Java, and hope to learn many more languages!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

When I'm not professionally stressing, I like to watch TV and listen to music

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I can make my pinky and thumb into a 180º angle

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

After high school, I went on a trip all over Europe and in Switzerland, we canyoned through a river valley. It was both breathtaking and absolutely exhilarating!

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

Other than being a CS10 Reader and LA, I'll be consumed by my classes (CS61B, CS70, and an Arts Breadth) and my (potential) fraternity, ΣΑΜ.
