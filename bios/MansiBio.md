## WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Fremont, California, which is just about an hour south of Berkeley (also happens to be the end of a Bart line). As a high school senior who had no idea what I wanted to major in, Berkeley seemed like a really great place for me to learn about and explore all of my interests (all 8 of my classes from freshman year were from different departments, so it's safe to say I did my fair share of exploring). Since my freshman year, I've grown to love Cal, and I can't imagine myself anywhere else!

## HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I first starting programming in CS10 during the spring of my freshman year, and I've taken CS classes ever since! I've programmed in Snap (yay CS10), Python (also yay CS10), Java, SQL, Swift, C, and some others!

## WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I really enjoy reading, watching TV, and singing (though Iâ€™m not very good at it).

## WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I'm really good at repeating stories (sorry)

## HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

Last summer, I went skydiving! It was the most terrifying and exciting moment of my summer for sure.

## WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
Teaching (I'll be teaching CS10 and the Data Science for Social Good Decal) and my classes: CS61C (taught by Dan!!), Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning in Education, and Human Happiness.
